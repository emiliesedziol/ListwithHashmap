# ListwithHashmap
Learning HashMaps within a list
Data being passed List<Map<String, Object>>
Within the Map String is the key name and Object is the value which can be String, Int or Double
In this case each Map is as follows 
  Name    <user name>
  Loan    <original loan amount>
  Make    <vehicle make>
  Paidoff <amount paid off>
  
  Add to the hashmap the percent of the loan paid off
  Sort by the percent
  Originally the sorted Map has the least percent paid off
  to change this multiply the loan by -1 to get a sort by the most percent paid off.
